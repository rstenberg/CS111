lab1.c:
The lab1.c file holds the c source code for the main program. The program reads from stdin and writes the text to stdout. Once compiled into an executable, lab1 can currently be executed with four optional arguments. The getopt library is used to parse the four options "--rdonly <file>", "--wronly <file>", "--verbose", "--command i o e cmd args" and set appropriate flags. If the "--rdonly <file>" option is set then the specified <file> is opened with a read only property and given the next available file descriptor. If the file cannot be opened, an error is reported and the parent process will exit. If the "--wronly <file>" options is set then the specified <file> is opened with a write only property and given the next available file descriptor. If the file cannot be opened, an error is reported and the parent process will exit. If the "--verbose" option is set then the program set a verbose flag and all future options will be read back to stdout before execution. If the "--command i o e cmd args" option is set then the parent process will fork a new child process to execute the shell cmd given with specified input file descriptor, output file descriptor, and error file descriptor to replace stdin, stdout, and stderr. This cmd is passed the optional args if any are needed.


Makefile:
The Makefile holds the scripts to make, clean, check, and create a tarball of the contents of lab1. These options can be run using the "make" command as "make", "make clean", "make check", and "make dist" respectively. The default make command will create an executable for lab1. Make clean will rm all the object and .tar.gz files as if the executable was never built. Make check is not yet complete. Make dist will create a tarball file containing everything needed for submission for lab1.
