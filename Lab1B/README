lab1.c:
The lab1.c file holds the c source code for the main program. The program reads from stdin and writes the text to stdout. Once compiled into an executable, lab1 can currently be executed with four optional arguments. The getopt library is used to parse the following options:

File flags options
--append
--cloexec
--creat
--directory
--dsync
--excl
--nofollow
--nonblock
--rsync
--sync
--trunc

File opening options
--rdonly f
	If the "--rdonly f" option is set then the specified file 'f' is opened with read only permission and given the next available file descriptor.
	If the file cannot be opened, an error is reported and the parent process will exit.
--wronly f
	If the "--wronly f" options is set then the specified file 'f' is opened with write only permission and given the next available file descriptor.
	If the file cannot be opened, an error is reported and the parent process will exit.
--rdwr f
	If the "--rdwr f" options is set then the specified file 'f' is opened with read-write permissions and given the next available file descriptor.
	If the file cannot be opened, an error is reported and the parent process will exit.
--pipe
	If the "--pipe" option is set then the next two avaiable file descriptors are allocated (the first as a read only, and the second as a write only).

Subcommand options
--command i o e cmd args
	If the "--command i o e cmd args" option is set then the parent process will fork a new child process to execute the shell cmd given with specified input file descriptor, output file descriptor, and error file descriptor to replace stdin, stdout, and stderr. This cmd is passed the optional args if any are needed.
--wait
	If the "--wait" option is set then the parent process will wait for all child processes to finish. It will also output each exit status and command as they finish.

Miscellaneous options
--close N
	If the "--close N" option is set then the file with descriptor N will be closed.
--verbose
	If the "--verbose" option is set then the program set a verbose flag and all future options will be read back to stdout before execution.
--profile
	Not yet implemented.
--abort
	If the "--abort" option is set then the parent program will cause a segmentation fault causing the shell to crash.
--catch N
	If the "--catch N" option is set then any signal 'N' will be caught and reported to stderr.
--ignore N
	If the "--ignore N" option is set then any signal 'N' will be ignored.
--default N
	If the "--default N" option is set then any signal 'N' will trigger its default behavior.
--pause
	If the "--pause" option is set then the parent process will pause and wait for a signal.

Makefile:
The Makefile holds the scripts to make, clean, check, and create a tarball of the contents of lab1. These options can be run using the "make" command as "make", "make clean", "make check", and "make dist" respectively. The default make command will create an executable for lab1. Make clean will rm all the object and .tar.gz files as if the executable was never built. Make check will run a total of 6 test in order to check that the simpsh executable can 1) report back commands with the verbose option 2) open files, 3) run commands on child processes, 4) create output files, 5) cause a seg fault with the abort option, and 6) close file descriptors properly. Make dist will create a tarball file containing everything needed for submission for lab1.
